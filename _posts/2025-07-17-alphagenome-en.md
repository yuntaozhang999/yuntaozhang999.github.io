*   **Solution:**
    *   Break down the code step-by-step.
    *   Show the sequence structure before and after padding.
    *   Verify that the original sequence is indeed in the center.

**Issue: Source of Information for Supported Sequence Lengths**
*   **Symptom:** Questioning the origin of the sequence length list in the documentation.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Point out that the information comes from `src/alphagenome/models/dna_client.py`.
    *   Show the `SUPPORTED_SEQUENCE_LENGTHS` constant definition.
    *   Explain that these lengths are all powers of 2.

### 7. Deeper Understanding of Genomic Concepts

**Issue: Biological Significance of a 1MB Genomic Interval**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding why predictions are made for a long interval of 1MB (1,000,000 base pairs).
*   **Solution:**
    *   Explain that gene expression is influenced not only by the gene itself but also by surrounding regulatory sequences.
    *   A 1MB region can contain: the gene itself, promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements.
    *   Analogy: It's like understanding a restaurant's business by looking at the surrounding 1km environment (commercial district, traffic, etc.).

**Issue: Confusion About the Concept of a Transcript**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding the definition and importance of a transcript.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Basic Concept:** A transcript is an RNA molecule transcribed from DNA.
    *   **Process:** DNA → RNA (Transcript) → Protein.
    *   **Types:** `mRNA`, `rRNA`, `tRNA`, `lncRNA`, etc.
    *   A single gene can produce multiple transcripts through alternative splicing.

**Issue: Unclear Human Genome Versioning System**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding the differences between versions like `hg19`, `hg38`, and `T2T-CHM13`.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Version History:** `hg16` → `hg17` → `hg18` → `hg19` → `hg38` → `T2T-CHM13`.
    *   **Naming Convention:** `hg` = Human Genome, number = version number.
    *   **Major Improvements:** `hg38` corrected errors in `hg19`, and `T2T` provided the first complete assembly of centromeres and telomeres.
    *   **Importance:** The position of the same variant can differ between versions.

**Issue: Confusion Between GENCODE Version and Genome Version**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding why there are two versioning systems.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Genome Version (e.g., hg38):** The version of the DNA sequence itself, like a base map.
    *   **GENCODE Version (e.g., v46):** The version of the gene annotations, like labels on the map.
    *   **Update Frequency:** Genome versions are updated slowly, while GENCODE versions are updated more frequently.
    *   **Usage Principle:** They must be used together; do not mix versions.

**Issue: Difficulty Understanding the Nature of the Reference Genome**
*   **Symptom:** Confusion about why a single reference genome is used when everyone's genome is different.
*   **Solution:**
    *   The reference genome is a "standard template," not the genome of a specific individual.
    *   **Analogy:** A standard dictionary vs. a personal handwritten copy.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a unified coordinate system to describe individual differences.
    *   **Individual Variation:** Genomes are 99.9% identical, with only 0.1% variation.

**Issue: Does the Reference Genome Contain Variation Information?**
*   **Symptom:** Uncertainty about whether the reference genome includes information about various genetic variants.
*   **Solution:**
    *   The reference genome contains only the "standard sequence," with a single base at each position.
    *   Variant information is stored in separate databases: `dbSNP`, `gnomAD`, `ClinVar`, `1000 Genomes`.
    *   **Storage Efficiency:** This avoids a massive increase in data size.
    *   **Practical Application:** Reference genome + variant information = complete individual genome analysis.

**Issue: Difficulty Understanding the GTF File Format**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding the structure and content of GTF (Gene Transfer Format) files.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Basic Concept:** GTF is a standard format for describing genome annotations, like a "map" of the genome.
    *   **File Structure:** A tab-separated text file with 9 columns per line.
    *   **First 8 Standard Columns:**
        1.  Chromosome name (`chr1`, `chr2`, `chrX`, etc.)
        2.  Annotation source (`ENSEMBL`, `HAVANA`)
        3.  Feature type (`gene`, `transcript`, `exon`, `CDS`, etc.)
        4.  Start position (1-based)
        5.  End position
        6.  Score (usually `.`)
        7.  Strand (`+`/`-`)
        8.  Phase (`0`,`1`,`2`,`.`)
    *   **9th Column (Attributes):** Stores attributes in a `key "value";` format.
        *   **Required fields:** `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, `gene_name`, etc.
        *   **Optional fields:** `protein_id`, `transcript_support_level`, etc.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Gene → Transcript → Exon/CDS/UTR.
    *   **Practical Application:** Finding gene locations, analyzing gene structure, processing genomic data.

### 8. Advanced Analysis Techniques

**Issue: Unclear Principle of ISM (In Silico Mutagenesis) Analysis**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding how to simulate and analyze the effects of mutations using a computer.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Basic Principle:** Systematically substitute every possible base at each position of a target sequence.
    *   **Mutation Strategy:** For 256 positions, try 3 substitutions at each position (excluding the original base).
    *   **Matrix Construction:** Generate 768 variants (256 × 3), creating a (256, 4) dimensional ISM matrix.
    *   **Reference Sequence Handling:** Set the reference sites to 0 by using `multiply_by_sequence=True`.

**Issue: Difficulty Choosing a Variant Prediction Strategy**
*   **Symptom:** Not knowing when to use a gene-specific scorer versus a general-purpose scorer.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Gene-Specific Scorer:**
        *   **Use Case:** Studying the function of a specific gene.
        *   **Advantage:** Optimized for the target gene, leading to more accurate predictions.
        *   **Disadvantage:** Can only be used for a specific gene, poor generalizability.
    *   **CenterMaskScorer:**
        *   **Use Case:** Comparing the effects of variants in different genomic regions.
        *   **Advantage:** Highly generalizable, can be used for any genomic region.
        *   **Disadvantage:** May be less precise than a gene-specific scorer.

**Issue: Difficulty Interpreting Sequence Logos**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding the meaning of the height and color in a sequence logo.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Height Meaning:** Represents the degree of impact of that position on the prediction result.
    *   **Color Coding:** Different bases are represented by different colors (A-Red, T-Blue, G-Orange, C-Green).
    *   **Calculation Method:** Based on information entropy and positional weights.
    *   **Interpretation Principle:** The higher the stack, the more important the position; the color indicates the most important base.

**Issue: Unfamiliarity with the AnnData Data Structure**
*   **Symptom:** Not understanding the roles of `.obs`, `.var`, `.X`, and `.uns`.
*   **Solution:**
    *   `.obs`: Metadata for observations (usually cells or samples).
    *   `.var`: Metadata for variables (usually genes).
    *   `.X`: The primary data matrix (expression levels, scores, etc.).
    *   `.uns`: Unstructured data (parameters, configuration information, etc.).
    *   **Naming Convention:** Gene names are used as the index for easy biological interpretation.

**Issue: Choosing a Method for Calculating Reference Sequence Position Values**
*   **Symptom:** Not knowing how to choose between methods like `mean_abs`, `max_abs`, `std`, `rms`.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Actual AlphaGenome Usage:** A simple mean calculation method.
    *   **Specific Implementation:** `scores np.mean(scores, axis=-1, where=filled, keepdims=True)`
    *   **Calculation Logic:** The reference sequence value at each position = the negative of the average effect of all variants at that position.
    *   **Source Code Evidence:** Can be found in `/src/alphagenome/interpretation/ism.py` on line 142.
    *   **Other Methods:** `mean_abs`, `max_abs`, `std`, `rms` are theoretically possible aggregation methods, but they are not used by AlphaGenome.
