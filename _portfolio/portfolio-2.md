**The Challenge:**  
Manual interpretation and commenting on LC-MS intact mass results is time-consuming and requires expert insight. No existing solution provided dynamic visualization of data across a 96-well plate.

**My Solution:**  
I developed an automated tool with two core functionalities:

- **AI-Driven Comment Generation:**  
  - Integrates Protein Metrics data with plate metadata  
  - Sends data to GPT-4.1 via Azure OpenAI API using tailored prompts  
  - Produces expert-level, concise, and accessible comments for each sample

- **Interactive 96-Well Plate Heatmap Visualization:**  
  - Processes exported data to create an HTML-format 96-well plate heatmap  
  - Color-coded species categories for easy differentiation

**Impact:**  
- Automated a highly specialized task  
- Improved clarity and consistency of reports  
- Enabled rapid identification of trends  
- Facilitated faster, more informed decision-making

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Azure OpenAI API, Prompt Engineering, HTML
