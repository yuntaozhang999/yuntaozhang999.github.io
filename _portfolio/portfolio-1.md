### The Challenge
High-throughput LC-MS intact mass analysis is essential for biologics screening, but its efficiency is hindered by tedious manual sequence setup and data prep steps, which slow workflows, increase errors, and limit throughput.

### My Solution
I developed a toolkit to significantly streamline this process, initially targeting our group's specific LC-MS workflow. The toolkit is also designed to be adaptable for other similar assays with some modifications:

- **Automated Sequence Generation:**  
  Utilizes plate map information provided by users and automatically generates a CSV file for ThermoFisher Xcalibur and another for Byos (Protein Metrics).
- **User-Friendly Design:**  
  GUI for non-programmers, auto-installs Python packages, customizable settings for naming and storage.

### Impact
- Reduced a manual task from ~15 min to ~15 sec for a single sequence.
- Minimized human errors.
- Improved user experience.

### Technologies Used
Python, Tkinter (GUI), CSV Processing
