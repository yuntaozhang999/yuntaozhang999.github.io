Welcome! I am a senior scientist based in the San Francisco Bay Area, specializing in bioanalytical and physical chemistry, mass spectrometry, and AI-driven scientific data analysis. My passion lies in bridging advanced analytical chemistry with artificial intelligence to accelerate biologics characterization, drug discovery, and our understanding of health and aging.

## About Me

- **Current Role:** Senior Scientist at Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)
- **Expertise:** Mass spectrometry, protein/peptide analysis, biologics characterization, workflow automation, AI and machine learning for scientific data
- **Education:**
  - Ph.D. in Bioanalytical and Physical Chemistry, University of the Pacific
  - M.S. in Environmental Engineering, University of the Pacific
  - B.S. in Ecology, University of Science and Technology Beijing

## Unique Skillset

With a strong foundation in analytical chemistry and a deep interest in coding and AI, I have developed a unique interdisciplinary profile. My work combines hands-on expertise in mass spectrometry and biologics with advanced computational approaches—including Python, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agent frameworks. This enables me to design innovative solutions for complex scientific challenges, from high-throughput data processing to expert-level data interpretation.

## Impact & Achievements

- **Biologics Characterization at BMS:** Led the implementation of carbene footprinting for high-resolution epitope mapping, and developed novel LC-MS methods to support bispecific, ADC, and CAR-T programs.
- **Workflow Automation:** Created automated toolkits for LC-MS sequence generation and AI-powered data communication, reducing manual setup time from minutes to seconds and minimizing errors.
- **AI for Analytical Chemistry:** Built tools that leverage large language models (LLMs) for expert comment generation and interactive data visualization, improving clarity and decision-making.
- **Mentorship & Collaboration:** Trained and mentored scientists in advanced MS and computational techniques, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.
