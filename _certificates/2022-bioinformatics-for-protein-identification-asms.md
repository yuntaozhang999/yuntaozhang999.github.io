**Issued by:** American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS)  
**Instructors:** Nuno Bandeira (University of California, San Diego), David Tabb (Stellenbosch University)  
**Completed on:** June 5th, 2022

**Course Overview:**  
This course provides a deep dive into the bioinformatics tools and algorithms that are essential for identifying proteins from shotgun LC-MS/MS datasets. It is designed for proteomics researchers to move beyond using software as a "black box" and gain a solid understanding of its inner workings. The curriculum focuses on the key steps in protein identification, from peptide-spectrum matching and error rate estimation to protein assembly, and also explores advanced techniques like spectral library searching and de novo sequencing.

**Key Topics & Skills Acquired:**
*   **Protein Identification Fundamentals:** Peptide-spectrum matching, error rate estimation (target/decoy, distributional analysis), and protein assembly/parsimony.
*   **Database Search Algorithms:** Understanding the structure, configuration, and implementation of various search engines.
*   **Advanced Identification Techniques:** Spectral library searching, de novo sequence inference, and analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
*   **Hands-On Software Experience:** Gained practical skills with major proteomics software pipelines through live demonstrations:
    *   **Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP)** from Seattle Proteome Center (ISB)
    *   **ProteoSAFe** from the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry (UCSD)
    *   **BumberDash / IDPicker** from the Tabb Laboratory

**Curriculum:**
The course was structured over two days:
*   **Day 1:** Focused on database search algorithms, error rate estimation, protein parsimony, and a hands-on session with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.
*   **Day 2:** Covered spectral library searching, post-translational modifications, and hands-on sessions with BumberDash/IDPicker and ProteoSAFe.

This course provided a robust theoretical and practical foundation in the bioinformatics of protein identification, enabling more reliable and informed analysis of proteomics data.
