**Issued by:** American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS)  
**Instructors:** Brendan MacLean (University of Washington), Devon Kohler (Northeastern University), Deanne Plubell (University of Washington), Olga Vitek (Northeastern University)  
**Completed on:** June 2nd, 2024

**Course Overview:**  
This case-study-driven course provides hands-on training in the analysis of quantitative proteomics data. It is designed for researchers who want to gain practical experience with state-of-the-art workflows for both Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. The curriculum moves from experimental design and data acquisition considerations to in-depth statistical analysis and interpretation, using real-world datasets from clinical and pre-clinical studies.

**Key Topics & Skills Acquired:**
*   **SRM Data Analysis:** Analyzing a case-control SRM dataset, with a focus on study design (normalization, randomization), chromatogram visualization, and statistical analysis using MSstats.
*   **DIA Data Analysis:** Processing and analyzing a modern Orbitrap DIA dataset from a neurodegenerative disease cohort, exploring how data collection and processing choices (e.g., batching, filtering, missing values) impact statistical outcomes.
*   **Statistical Interpretation:** Gaining proficiency in setting up, conducting, and interpreting statistical results for complex quantitative proteomics experiments.
*   **Hands-On Software Experience:** Gaining practical skills with the **Skyline** and **MSstats** software ecosystems for robust analysis of both SRM and DIA data.
*   **Experimental Design Principles:** Understanding the importance of proper experimental design, including the roles of biological and technical replicates, randomization, and normalization in generating reliable results.

**Curriculum:**
The course was structured around two in-depth case studies over two days:
*   **Day 1: Introduction & SRM Case Study:** Focused on the fundamentals of quantitative analysis and a deep dive into an SRM dataset from a heart failure study.
*   **Day 2: Advanced Topics & DIA Case Study:** Covered the analysis of a complex DIA dataset from a Parkinson's and Alzheimer's cohort, emphasizing advanced data processing and statistical considerations.

This course provided practical, case-driven training in designing, executing, and interpreting quantitative proteomics experiments using state-of-the-art software tools.
