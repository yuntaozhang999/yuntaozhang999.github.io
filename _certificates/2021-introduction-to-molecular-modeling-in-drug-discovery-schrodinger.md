**Issued by:** Schrödinger  
**Completed on:** April 28th, 2021

**Course Overview:**  
This course provides a foundational understanding of computational molecular modeling tools and their application in drug discovery. It is designed for scientists who wish to learn industry-standard methods for small molecule design. The curriculum offers hands-on experience with Schrödinger’s Maestro and LiveDesign platforms, covering key workflows from protein preparation and ligand docking to collaborative design in a real-world case study.

**Key Skills Acquired:**
*   **Molecular Modeling Fundamentals:** Gained a strong understanding of the theory and practical application of computational tools in drug discovery projects.
*   **Maestro Proficiency:** Developed hands-on skills in using the Maestro graphical user interface for tasks such as modifying small molecules, viewing protein-ligand interactions, and preparing structures for modeling.
*   **Structure & Ligand-Based Design:** Learned best practices for protein and ligand preparation (LigPrep), ligand docking for structure-based virtual screening, and shape-based screening for ligand-based design.
*   **Collaborative Drug Design:** Utilized the LiveDesign platform to organize data, apply workflows for multi-parameter optimization, and ideate novel compounds in a collaborative environment.
*   **Practical Application:** Completed an independent case study on designing novel VEGFR2 inhibitors, demonstrating mastery of the course content from hit analysis to analog ideation.

**Curriculum:**
The course was structured into seven modules, covering:
1.  **Introduction to Molecular Modeling:** The value and application of modeling in case studies.
2.  **Maestro Fundamentals:** Core skills for navigating the interface and modifying molecules.
3.  **Protein-Ligand Interactions:** Visualization, ligand preparation, and alignment.
4.  **Structure-Based Virtual Screening:** Protein preparation, grid generation, and ligand docking.
5.  **Ligand-Based Virtual Screening:** Shape-based screening methods.
6.  **LiveDesign Workflows:** Collaborative data organization and ideation.
7.  **VEGFR2 Case Study:** A final project applying all learned skills to a real-world target.

This course provided practical, hands-on training in the essential workflows for modern computational drug discovery.
